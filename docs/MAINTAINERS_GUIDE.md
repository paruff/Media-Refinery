## Triage Process

1. **Monitoring Issues and PRs**
   - Regularly check the `Issues` and `Pull Requests` tabs.
   - Label new issues appropriately (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).
   - Assign issues to maintainers or contributors when applicable.

2. **Responding to Issues**
   - Respond to new issues within 48 hours.
   - Request additional information if necessary.
   - Close issues that are duplicates or no longer relevant with an appropriate comment.

3. **Reviewing Pull Requests**
   - Ensure PRs adhere to the contribution guidelines.
   - Conduct thorough reviews, checking for functionality, code quality, and tests.
   - Use `Request Changes` or `Approve` actions.
   - Merge PRs only after successful reviews and passing CI checks.

## Release Management

1. **Versioning**
   - Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
     - Increment `MAJOR` for incompatible changes.
     - Increment `MINOR` for new features.
     - Increment `PATCH` for bug fixes.

2. **Release Process**
   - Plan releases during `sprint review` or milestone completion.
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of changes.
   - Create a release tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and publish the release.

3. **Post-Release**
   - Announce releases through appropriate channels (e.g., GitHub Releases, team communication platforms).
   - Monitor for regressions or critical bugs and address promptly.

## Decision-Making

1. **Principles**
   - Favor group consensus when making decisions.

2. **Process**

   - Allow time for community feedback (typically 7 days).
   - Formalize approved changes with an Implementation Plan.

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Utilize discussion threads and meetings to resolve disagreements.
   - Encourage compromise and a positive team environment.
